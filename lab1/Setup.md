# Tool Setup

This documents describes how to setup all tools on an Linux/Ubuntu
laptop. We also include pointers for the Windows setup.

## Chisel

Chisel is *just* a library for Scala. And Scala is just a language that executes
on the JVM. Therefore, you need a JVM installed on your laptop, which you probably
have already.



## Vivado

Vivado is the synthesize tool from Xilinx for the Basys3 FPGA board.
The WebPACK edition is freely available at:
https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado/vivado-webpack.html

 * Download [Vivado WebPACK](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado/vivado-webpack.html)
   * You need to register with Xilinx

 * For Linux the installer executable can be run with ```bash Xilinx...```
   * see
     [Digilent Installation](https://reference.digilentinc.com/vivado/installing-vivado/start)
     for instructions
 * Install cable drivers and Digilent boards files (according to the above instructions)

## Ubuntu/Linux

This is the log when I prepared the VM for the DE 2 lab. It may be helpful to setup
your Linux system for the DE 2 lab.
