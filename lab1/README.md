# Lab Session 1

## Hello World in Chisel

The lab session will show you a Hello World example (a blinking LED)
in Chisel.
We will explore the tools needed for the Chisel based design flow.

After the lab you will have a good overview of the tools used to
edit and compile a hardware design coded in Chisel.
You will be able to synthesize this design and configure the FPGA
board.
